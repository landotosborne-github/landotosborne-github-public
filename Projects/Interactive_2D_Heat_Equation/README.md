# landotosborne-github-public/Projects/Interactive_2D_Heat_Equation

This is a project I completed in March 2023 for my Physics 129L: Computational Physics Lab final project.
It is a simulation of the 2D heat equation in a curses interface wrapper. It is fully customizable and computes the 2D heat equation for a grid of points, from the FTCS finite difference method of numerical computational.

For more detail and examples please view the project report in heat_report.pdf.

To use the project download heat_project.tar.gz which is just a zipped tar file of the programs and contents of the project. Make sure all required python libraries are installed and up to date (numpy, matplotlib, PIL, numba, and curses). Then running the executable file, heat_project.py, will start the program and turn the terminal into a curses text based interface.

Enjoy!
